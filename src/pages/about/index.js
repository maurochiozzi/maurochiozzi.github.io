        <p>
          I'm Mechanical <span className="highlight">[Engineer]</span> and
          passionate about overall engineering, and I might say it's because all
          my creativity developed as a child during my joyful days playing with{" "}
          <span className="highlight">[Lego]</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To keep filling my creativity, I enrolled in{" "}
          <a
            href="https://www.ufrn.br/en"
            target="_blank"

          </a>{" "}
          where I first graduated with a Bachelor in Science & Technology. The
          first year I had my first programming class: it was love at first
          sight. The following year I started lessoning programming and nowadays
          I am still developing my{" "}
          <span className="highlight">[coding skills]</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later on, after finishing the Bachelor's course, I enrolled on the
          Mechanical Engineering course, where I could develop more skills in
          the area that I'm passionate about. Also,{" "}
          <span className="highlight">[team development]</span> was possible as
          well as a development in{" "}
          <span className="highlight">[problem-solving]</span> with the
          <span className="highlight">[hard work]</span> time active with the{" "}
          <span className="highlight">[Car-Kar√°]</span> Baja SAE and AeroDesign
          SAE <span className="highlight">[Teams]</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In general, I'm highly motivated by the daily challenges and the
          knowledge awarded aside from the{" "}
          <span className="highlight">[goals achieved]</span>. My mission,
          besides self-development, is to{" "}
          <span className="highlight">[help people]</span> achieve their goals
          by sharing knowledge between both parties and by managing to lead them
          (or us) to <span className="highlight">[key results]</span>.
