        <p>Hello, there! I'm Mauro Chiozzi!</p>

        <p>
          I'm Mechanical <span className="highlight">[Engineer]</span> and
          passionate for overall engineering, and I might say it's because all
          my creative developed as a child during my joyful days playing with{" "}
          <span className="highlight">[Lego]</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To keep on filling my creativity, I enrolled on{" "}
          <a
            href="https://www.ufrn.br/en"

          where I first graduate as Bachelor in Science & Technology. The first
          year I had my first programming class: it was love on the first sight.
          The following year I started lessoning programming and nowadays I
          still developing my <span className="highlight">[coding skills]</span>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          Later on, after finishing the Bachelor course, I enrolled on the
          Mechanical Engineering course, where I could develop more skills in
          the area that I'm passionate about. Also,{" "}
          <span className="highlight">[team-development]</span> was possible as
          well as a development in{" "}
          <span className="highlight">[problem-solving]</span> with the
          <span className="highlight">[hard work]</span> time active with the{" "}
          <span className="highlight">[Car-Kar√°]</span> Baja SAE and AeroDesign
          SAE <span className="highlight">[Teams]</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In general, I'm highly motived by the daily challenges and the
          knowledge awarded aside with the{" "}
          <span className="highlight">[goals achieved]</span>. My mission is,
          besides the self-development, is to{" "}
          <span className="highlight">[help people]</span> achieve their goals
          by sharing knowledge between both parts and by managing to lead then
          (or us) to <span className="highlight">[key results]</span>.
